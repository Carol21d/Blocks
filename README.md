# Blocks
## Write and application to find out the output of the following inputs:
- a) 0 h 2 3 5 1 v 3 1 1
- b) 0 h 2 3 1 1 h 2 3 1
- c) 0 h 2 3 5 1 h 3 3 2
- d) 0 h 2 3 5 1 h 4 1 2
- e) 0 h 2 3 5 1 v 3 1 3
- f) 0 h 8 7 2 1 v 10 7 6
- g) 0 h 2 3 5 1 v 3 1 2
- h) 0 h 4 3 3 2 v 6 2 2
- i) 0 v 3 3 2 1 v 3 5 2
- j) 0 h 1 3 2 1 h 5 3 2

Try to use different classes to model the different entities implied in the solution. You can use aprogramming language of your choice (we prefer PHP) or even pseudo-language.
## Instructions:
A block:
- is always rectangular
- has an id (0-based)
- has a position (x, y) in the matrix defined by the left bottom corner (= blue circle) of the block
-  has a length
- has a width, which is always one

A block‘s orientation is either vertical („v“) or horizontal („h“). You can move:
- vertical blocks only vertically: up (positive number) or down (negative number)
- horizontal blocks only horizontally: right (positive number) or left (negative number)
